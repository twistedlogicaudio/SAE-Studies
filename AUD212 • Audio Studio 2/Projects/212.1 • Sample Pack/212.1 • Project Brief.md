# 212.1 ‚Ä¢ Project Brief

Recording artists often collate products such as virtual instruments and sound packs in themed or stylistically cohesive bundles, and market them to other creatives. As recording studios get smaller and the consumer market expands, music-makers rely heavily on these products to gain easy access to a large array of pre-recorded/programmed instruments, sounds and loops.
This project will give you insight into an alternative way to market and promote your skills as a recording artist.
